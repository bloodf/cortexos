/**
 * session-gc.ts — garbage-collect expired admin_sessions rows.
 *
 * A1 (persistent sessions) made the DrizzleSessionStore the default.
 * Sessions are written with `expires_at = now + 30d` and rolled forward
 * on every request via `touch()`. Old rows accumulate: a user who logs
 * in once and never returns leaves a row for 30 days; a user who
 * logs in 1000 times leaves 1000 rows (only one is the active session
 * at any time, the rest are stale).
 *
 * `gcExpiredSessions()` deletes rows where `expires_at < NOW()` and
 * returns the number of rows removed. It is safe to call concurrently
 * — the underlying DELETE is atomic per-row in PostgreSQL.
 *
 * The DrizzleSessionStore exposes this so:
 *   1. The hooks.server.ts can call it once per N requests (cheap
 *      probabilistic GC, no separate timer needed).
 *   2. The dashboard's installer / startup script can call it once
 *      at boot to clean up before the systemd service starts
 *      serving traffic.
 *   3. Tests can call it directly to verify the GC behaviour.
