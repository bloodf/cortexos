/**
 * One-off maintenance: drain the stale pre-fix review backlog.
 *
 * Background: 313 of ~321 open `mail_guardian_reviews` rows were generated
 * before the 2026-06-15 MIME-decode fix, when the classifier+verifier were fed
 * raw MIME garbage. Because auto-quarantine requires BOTH the classify and the
 * verify pass to agree above threshold (see processor.ts `shouldAutoQuarantine`),
 * the garbage-era verify pass routinely disagreed/failed, so even high-confidence
 * spam fell through to the Review folder instead of auto-trashing. The result is
 * a large, stale operational backlog that no longer reflects anything actionable
 * (the messages are already out of the inbox, parked in the Review mailbox, and
 * many source messages have since been expunged).
 *
 * What this does: marks the trustworthy subset of that backlog
 *   resolved_at IS NULL
 *   AND requested_at < '2026-06-15'        (pre-fix / garbage era only)
 *   AND model_verdict = 'spam'
 *   AND model_confidence >= 0.82           (>= auto-quarantine threshold)
 * as resolved with owner_decision = 'spam', approver = 'backlog-drain'.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do (and why):
 *   - It does NOT call applyReviewDecision / moveToTrash. Firing ~294 IMAP MOVEs
 *     on garbage-era messages whose UIDs have mostly been reassigned/expunged
 *     would error and churn for no benefit. The mail is already in the Review
 *     folder, out of the inbox.
 *   - It does NOT add 'block' sender rules. Garbage-era from_hash values are not
 *     trustworthy enough to drive permanent sender blocks.
 *   - It does NOT write the learning corpus (updateDecisionOutcome). Garbage-era
 *     decisions should not train the owner-preference brief.
 *   It is a pure, reversible DB queue-clear of known-bad-era spam reviews.
 *
 * It intentionally LEAVES untouched: every post-fix review (>= 2026-06-15), all
 * non-spam verdicts (not_spam / uncertain), and the 3 low-confidence (<0.82)
 * pre-fix spam rows — those still deserve a human glance.
 *
 * Safety:
 *   - DRY-RUN by default: prints the exact predicate, the matched count, and a
 *     sample. Performs NO writes.
 *   - With `--execute`: runs a single UPDATE in a transaction and prints the
 *     affected row count.
 *   - Reversible: every touched row carries approver = 'backlog-drain', so it
 *     can be undone with:
 *       UPDATE mail_guardian_reviews
 *         SET resolved_at = NULL, owner_decision = NULL, approver = NULL
 *       WHERE approver = 'backlog-drain';
 *
 * Credentials: DB creds come from DATABASE_URL / DB_* (supplied by
 * .secrets/dashboard.env in prod). No IMAP / model creds needed.
 *
 * Run (dry-run):
 *   set -a; source /opt/cortexos/.secrets/dashboard.env; set +a
 *   pnpm --filter @cortexos/mail-guardian exec tsx scripts/drain-stale-review-backlog.ts
 *
 * Run for real (after reviewing the dry-run):
 *   ... (same env) ...
 *   pnpm --filter @cortexos/mail-guardian exec tsx scripts/drain-stale-review-backlog.ts --execute
