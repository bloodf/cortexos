/**
 * Drizzle client bound to PGlite (in-memory Postgres in WASM).
 *
 * Use only in tests. PGlite is a real Postgres engine compiled to WASM —
 * JSONB, INET, TIMESTAMPTZ, CHECK constraints, and partial indexes all
 * work. The only thing it does NOT support is the TimescaleDB extension,
 * so the `audit_log` hypertable conversion in `001_schema.sql` is
 * effectively a no-op against PGlite (the table is still usable as a
 * regular Postgres table).
 *
 * Rationale for PGlite over `better-sqlite3`:
 *   The CortexOS schema is PG-flavored (JSONB, INET, arrays, CHECK
 *   constraints, partial indexes). A SQLite Drizzle schema would need a
 *   parallel set of column definitions and would not exercise the real
 *   migrations. PGlite runs the actual `migrations/*.sql` files and the
 *   actual Drizzle schema, so unit tests are faithful to production.
 *
 * For real-Docker-Postgres integration tests, use the `getDb()` from
 * `client.ts` against a `pg-mem` or `testcontainers` Postgres.
